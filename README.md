Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance
in various fields such as object detection, semantic segmentation,
and image classification [10, 26, 30]. The performance of deep neural
networks varies depending on the architecture. State-of-the-art
results have been obtained by designing large neural networks
with increased depth [11], width [46], and cardinality [45].
